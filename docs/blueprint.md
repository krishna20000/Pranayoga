## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Burnt Rose (#C4827D) for a sensual and grounding feel, drawing from the concept of transformation through warmth.
- Background color: Sandstone Beige (#EFEAE3), offering a light, neutral base to enhance readability and create a serene backdrop, subtly echoing earth tones for a healing environment.
- Accent color: Deep Sage Green (#617766), provides contrast and a touch of nature-inspired tranquility, slightly on the "left" side of the primary color for a harmonious blend.
- Headings font: 'Playfair', a modern serif for headings.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that is both modern and readable. It will complement the heading font, but stand out as a contrast.
- Use minimalist line illustrations related to yoga poses and wellness practices with a subtle glow effect on hover.
- Subtle animations like parallax scrolling, letter-by-letter text entrances, and card lift effects for a modern, sensual feel.
